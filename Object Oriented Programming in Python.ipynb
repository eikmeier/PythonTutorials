    "\n",
    "In this lab we will explore **Object Oriented Programming**. Object oriented programming is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a class or object. Conceptually, you can think of a class or object as something that has data and can perform operations on that data. With object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical groupings using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level. Before we get ahead of ourselves, though, let's see an example:"
